    <p>
      I worked at a sandwich shop that made these vegetable sandwiches stuffed
      with cucumbers, sprouts, tomatoes, and avocadoes. They were a veggie's
      dream!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 thick slices whole wheat bread</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>6 slices cucumber</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons alfalfa sprouts</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
      <li>1 leaf lettuce</li>
      <li>1 ounce pepperonici, sliced</li>
      <li>Â½ avocado, mashed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
      Spread each slice of bread with 1 tablespoon cream cheese. On one slice of
      bread, arrange cucumber slices in a single layer. Cover with sprouts, then
      sprinkle with oil and vinegar. Layer tomato slices, lettuce, and
      pepperoncini. Spread other slice of bread with mashed avocado. Close
      sandwich and serve immediately.
